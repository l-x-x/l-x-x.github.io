## Collider Physics

Most of my collder physics researches focus on the LHC processes involving jets. Jets are clusters of highly boosted hadrons produced at colliders. They provide the unique chance to test QCD across several orders of magnitude in the energy scale and they are also important tools for new physics searches at the LHC. One of my research focus is to understand the jet from first principle calculations.
