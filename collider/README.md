## Collider Physics

Most of my collder physics researches focus on the LHC processes involving jets. Jets are clusters of highly boosted hadrons produced at colliders. They provide the unique chance to test QCD across several orders of magnitude in the energy scale and they are also important tools for new physics searches at the LHC. One of my research focus is to understand the jet from first principle calculations, including NNLO predictions for the W/Z/H + jet, the resummed single inclusive jet production at the LHC and predictions for vairous jet substructure observables. Most predictions have been used for the experimantal analyses by ATLAS, CMS and STARS. Short term work in this direction will be to push the prediction of the resummed single inclusive jet production to its next accuracy level.
