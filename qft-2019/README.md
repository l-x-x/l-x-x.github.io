## Quantum Field Theory (Spring, 2019)

The course is designed at the introductory level to the quantum field theory for the graduate students at Beijing Normal University. The lecture notes and homework sets will be posted here.


### Lecture notes
- [lecture 1](https://l-x-x.github.io/qft-2019/notes/qft2019spring-1.pdf) (quantum mechanics as a 1+0 D field theory: canonical quantization, perturbation theory, asymptotic series, Feynman diagrams)
- [lecture 2](https://l-x-x.github.io/qft-2019/notes/qft2019spring-2.pdf)  (quantum mechanics as a 1+0 D field theory: Wick Theorem, Feynman rules, Parth integral)
- [lecture 3](https://l-x-x.github.io/qft-2019/notes/qft2019spring-3.pdf)  (quantum mechanics as a 1+0 D field theory: Parth integral,Harmonic Oscillator, Instanton, Dilute Instanton Gas) References: Coleman, [The Uses of Instantons](https://l-x-x.github.io/qft-2019/notes/Coleman-Instantons.pdf); Landau, Lifshitz, QM (2nd edition), chapter 23 problem 4, for solving K (discrete spectrum) and chapter 25 problem 5, for continuous spectrum.
