## Quantum Field Theory (Spring, 2019)

The course is designed at the introductory level to the quantum field theory for the graduate students at Beijing Normal University. The lecture notes and homework sets will be posted here.

- lecture 2 (quantum mechanics as a 1+0 D field theory: Feynman rules, Parth integral)


### Homework 
- problem sets 1 

### References
There are plenty open resources on QFT online including the famous [lectures by Sydney Coleman](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/videos/Phys253) hosted by Harvard.
