## Perturbative QCD

In particle physics, colliders are mandartory tools for us to unveal the underlying nature of our universe. While perturbative QCD (or perturbative field theories) is the only feasible method to allow us predict the collider phenomenologies out of the first principles. No substitution is known at the momentum. The way that perturbative QCD works is by expanding the predictions in terms of the strong coupling constant to the leading order, next-to-leading-order so on and so forth, to gradually approximate reality.  At the moment, Next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD predictions are highly welcomed by the collider physics for the purpose of either precision measurements or data descriptions. One of my research interests is developing the so-called jettiness subtraction scheme to realize the NNLO predictions for W/Z/H+jet in proton-proton collisions as well as lots of other interesting LHC processes. More studies in this direction are on-going, including understanding its power corrections, better phase space generator and its applications to the collider processes.
